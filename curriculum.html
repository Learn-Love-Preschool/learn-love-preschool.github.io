                  At Learn and Love Preschool, children learn through play,
                  whether that be solitary play (playing independently),
                  parallel play (playing next to others), associative play
                  (engaging with their peers), or simply onlooker play
                  (observing other children). Children are learning and becoming
                  more comfortable with their environment and the people in it
                  with any form of play. Learn and Love Preschool has a large
                  focus on social-emotional development. Children all learn at
                  their own pace and through their own methods. While at school,
                  children have amble opportunity to engage with children
                  through free choice, outdoor exploration, story time, group
                  discussions, and much more. Our curriculum encompasses:

                    We work on sharing, taking turns, listening to peers,
                    sitting at circle, walking in a line, and focusing on an
                    activity. We practice patience, manners, kindness, and
                    respect, as well as encourage participation. We teach
                    children to recognize their own emotions and that of their
                    peers and give them tools to help regulate their feelings.
                    We strive for children to form friendships and relationships
                    with their peers and teachers on daily basis. The curriculum
                    and play based program help children build their
                    independence, learn problem solving skills, and become
                    critical thinkers. In the beginning of the year, we like to
                    have the children create a list of rules to follow while at
                    school. We also do a lot of focus on routine during the
                    first weeks of school.

                    of outdoor time. Children work on small hand/finger
                    movements (write, pinch, grasp, etc.) by doing activities
                    such as beading, painting, and by using small manipulatives

                    We do weekly cooking/baking projects, some of which will
                    correspond with the week’s core lesson. When children are

                    may even stop being that picky eater. It will also

                    When playing children love to do what adults do. They can
                    act this out through dramatic play or imaginative play. To
                    improve their life skills, they can use Montessori inspired
                    materials or activities to practice folding or pouring.
                    During snack time, they practice self-serving with our
                    family style meals and work on cleaning up after themselves.
                    We learn about our senses, bodies (basic), germs and how to
                    stay healthy, good nutrition, and safety. We do plenty of
                    movement indoors and outdoors through games, dancing, and
                    recess.

                    We learn about our families and ourselves by doing All About
                    Me units and family and friendship lessons. We discuss the
                    traditions of different families, with a focus of the
                    families in the program. We learn about different cultures,
                    languages, and people around the world, and celebrate all
                    the holidays and birthdays.

                    We do a weekly/bi-weekly unit on a focus topic. It could be
                    anything, such as the 5 senses, trees, an animal, pumpkins,
                    emotions, transportation, dinosaurs, or the life cycle of a
                    butterfly. In the beginning of the year, we like to ask what
                    the children want to learn about and what their interests
                    are. Each unit of focus will incorporate songs, books, art
                    projects, group discussions, engaging activities, and
                    different materials in the classroom.
